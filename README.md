The file "Iwasawa module computation.txt" contains the MAGMA code to compute, given a real quadratic number field, the ideal J of the Iwasawa algebra Lambda such that the Iwasawa module associated to the cyclotomic Z_p-extension of the given number field is isomorphic to Lambda/J.

The other three files contain the ideals J for p = 3 and dicriminant of the real quadratic field less than 100000. The results are split according to the class modulo 3 of the dicriminant of the real quadratic field. The ideals are listed as a PARI/GP list.
